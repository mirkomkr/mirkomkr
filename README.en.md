## 📖 About Me

After several years working in the printing industry, I developed strong attention to detail, excellent time management skills, and resilience under pressure. These skills, combined with my passion for web technology, motivated me to pursue a structured learning path as a Front-End Developer. I completed the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera and am building a solid foundation in modern web technologies.

I am driven by the desire to keep growing and contribute with commitment and enthusiasm to innovative projects in dynamic environments.

## 🎯 Career Objective

I aim to create accessible, performant, and user-centered web solutions, applying and expanding my skills constantly. I am looking for an opportunity where I can learn, collaborate effectively, and make a meaningful impact within the team.

## 📚 Continuous Learning

Through hands-on projects (To-Do List, Weather App, E-commerce Cart) I deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and front-end best practices. Currently, I am advancing in JavaScript concepts and preparing to work with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
